         <h2>1980 Mercedes-Benz 300cd</h2>
         <p>This was a my first car, a 1980 Mercedes 300cd. Early on as a teenager, I started looking around for what cars I wanted to own some day, and I was enamored with my neighbor's two diesel Mercedes that he bought new in the 70s and 80s. I loved the styling of older cars, and thought that there must be something special about these Mercedes for people to keep them for so long. I also wanted to get into the car hobby and learn how to fix things myself.</p>

         <h2>1986 Subaru XT</h2>
         <p>However, my diesel Mercedes proved difficult to live with in the winter; it didn't handle great in the snow, and wouldn't even start below freezing sometimes. I had to keep long extension cords in the trunk and park near a power outlet, in case I needed to plug in its engine block heater. For winter driving, I picked up a four-wheel-drive 1986 Subaru XT and ended up loving it! It was a blast to drive in the snow and never got stuck in the nearly 10 years I owned it.</p>

         <h2>1982 Mercedes-Benz 240d</h2>
         <p>My next car was a 1982 Mercedes 240d with a manual transmission that was fairly clean, but needed a lot of work that I wasn't up for doing at the time.</p>

         <h2>1995 Mercedes-Benz e420</h2>
         <p>I ventured into the gasoline side of Mercedes with this 1995 e420. It may look like an unassuming small sedan, but it had a 275 horsepower V8 under its hood. With 'ice cold' A/C, great seats and stereo and a whole lot of power, this car had the recipe for success. I'm currently looking for another one of these to buy.</p>

         <h2>1996 Lexus SC400</h2>
         <p>Japanese cars are another favorite of mine, and I purchased one of the top imports of the 90's with this 1996 Lexus SC400. It had 70k miles, had been garaged since new and was in beautiful shape. It was my 'daily driver' for many years, but I felt that it was almost too nice for that purpose and sold it.</p>

         <h2 id="mainHeading">2002 Cadillac DeVille DHS</h2>
         <p>Next up is an enormous maroon Cadillac I purchased for a little over $400 at my then employer's private auction. With a new windshield and some emissions parts pulled from the salvage yard, it was back on the road for under $1,000 total. I'd definitely buy another Cadillac some day, my current favorite being the 1993-2002 Eldorado.</p>

         <h2>1983 Mercedes-Benz 380SEL</h2>
         <p>Another boat of a car was my 1983 Mercedes 380SEL, with the “L” referring to its extended wheelbase. It was purchased not-running for $500, and with a new fuel pump, tuneup, tires & battery it was a fun cruiser.</p>

         <h2>1980 Mercedes-Benz 240d</h2>
         <p id= "testP"><p class="funParagraph">My current hobby car is a 1980 Mercedes 240d that I did restoration work on – tons of repairs, and a color change to 'British Racing' green. I've owned it for five years and am casually looking for its replacement. These days, I wouldn't take on a project as massive as this was; the paint job alone took something like 6 months of work! </p>

         <h2>2004 Mercury Sable Wagon</h2>
         <p>This is my current 'grocery-getter', a fully-loaded 2004 Mercury Sable station wagon I bought for $500. It needed many new gaskets; oil used to leak onto the exhaust, causing smoke to pour out from under the hood! When the roads filled up again after pandemic lockdown, it seemed like driving became a lost art – I didn't want to drive a car I was too concerned about. I'm very pleased with this car and plan to keep it for as long as it holds up.</p>
